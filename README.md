### Fast collinear points

- my solution to the [assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/programming/prXiW/collinear-points)
  from
  the algorithms part 1 course.
- please only use this only as a reference/inspiration, do not copy it as your own solution.
- it only got me 98. if you want the extra 2 points, you need to use solve the time issue for larger grids.
